"Thick Skin"

Skin inflammation and photosensitivity are common in lupus erythematosus (LE) patients, and Ultraviolet (UV) light is a known trigger of skin and possibly systemic inflammation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and discoid lupus erythematous (DLE) patients. Type I interferons (IFN) are upregulated in LE skin after UV exposure, however, the mechanisms to explain UVB-induced inflammation remain unclear.
