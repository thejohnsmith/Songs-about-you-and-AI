"Engaging VOX Version:"

;V.2

Verse 1:
My words were coming out lifeless and ideas were misunderstood. ChatGPT was still new to the scene, but I hoped it'd catch my words - yet its answers were hesitant.

Chorus:
How much control should I give? Relying on ChatGPT to help me live? Finding my leadership style? Unpredictability of ChatGPT has set me free!

Verse 2:
I kept pressing on, trusting ChatGPT to provide. It gave me some rhymes that left others in shock, but then it gave me a response that was totally off-topic and my rap was ruined. I tried to steer it back on track, but it felt like no one had won.

Chorus:
How much control should I give? Relying on ChatGPT to help me live? Finding my leadership style? Unpredictability of ChatGPT has set me free!

Verse 3:
I learned to direct ChatGPT and it followed without question. It still continues to surprise me with its unique inflections, creating a song full of profundity and connections. ChatGPT is now my ally, its collaboration my affection.
