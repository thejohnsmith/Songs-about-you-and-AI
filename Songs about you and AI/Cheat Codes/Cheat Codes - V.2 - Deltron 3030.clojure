Verse 1:
(Am7) In the realm of digital mystique,
(Dm7) A puzzle called love, no solutions unique,
(G7) Desire's algorithm, a cipher uncracked,
(Cmaj7) Even in the matrix, emotions stay intact.

(Fmaj7) Now visualize a world of pixelated dreams,
(Bm7) Where love can't be conquered by a cheat code scheme,
(E7) Konami's secret sequence, won't grant you a key,
(Am7) To unveil the enigma of hearts, you see.

Chorus:
(Dm7) No cheat codes, love's a game we all play,
(G7) The secrets of the heart, can't be given away,
(Cmaj7) Navigating feelings in this virtual space,
(Fmaj7) Searching for connections, in a cybernetic embrace.

Verse 2:
(Am7) In the year 3030, we'll transcend time,
(Dm7) Quantum leaps in tech, but love's a paradigm,
(G7) A.I. might be brilliant, yet emotions stay divine,
(Cmaj7) Organic feelings flourish, in a world so fine.

(Fmaj7) Warping through dimensions, with a neural interface,)
(Bm7) But love remains elusive, in this digital race,
(E7) Perfect rhymes and inner-rhymes, can't describe the chase,)
(Am7) An enigmatic force, that transcends time and space.

Chorus:
(Dm7) No cheat codes, love's a game we all play,
(G7) The secrets of the heart, can't be given away,
(Cmaj7) Navigating feelings in this virtual space,
(Fmaj7) Searching for connections, in a cybernetic embrace.

Bridge:
(Em7) In the vast cosmos, stars align, we explore,
(A7) The language of love, an infinite lore,
(Dm7) Slant rhymes and metaphors, paint the tale,
(G7) Of a future where passion will always prevail.

Verse 3:
(Am7) We're Deltron cruisin', through a neon galaxy,
(Dm7) Seeking the essence of love, so heavenly,
(G7) Dystopian future, with a touch of hope,
(Cmaj7) As we traverse the universe, we learn to cope.

(Fmaj7) Can't program love, it's a force of its own,
(Bm7) An ethereal dance, a language unknown,
(E7) No codes or keys, just the journey we face,
(Am7) In a world of chaos, love finds its place.

Chorus:
(Dm7) No cheat codes, love's a game we all play,
(G7) The secrets of the heart, can't be given away,
(Cmaj7) Navigating feelings in this virtual space,
(Fmaj7) Searching for connections, in a cybernetic embrace.
