# Songs-about-you-and-AI
I'm writing an album from bed because I'm sick.
I was forced to retire from IT at 35 because of my health, and I had to give up everything.
Now I live in bed 22+ hours a day.

This project allows me to chip away at some progress at my whatever pace I can go.

Right now this is just a a spattering of lingual trash and alphabeats propped up by a few of my elementarty AI chat bot friends, but they're still learning.


You'll find that the songs are formatted as .clojure files. I did this for the simple purposes that Atom's native syntax highlighting differentiated just enough to seperate the Titles/parts and chords for the artist.

At the top of most song files I've kept a consistiet format --

"Title"
;ChatGPT3(4) Prompt (or Bard, or a refinement, ect.

Verse 1:
...Then it's straight into the song.

I've just started creating  alternate versions of the same songs, which I've extended the name to add the GPT alike changing just the artist artist to the new file name.

-- Docs -- Is with some scratch notes, Working folders, files for prompt shortcuts, ideas, song inspo, and any other new gems we collect. Use freely

Please don't be intimidated to pull down your own files or hit me with a cool idea you can think of.
